    "- In each code block, do NOT delete the # Q4-x-x comment at the top of a cell (it is needed for the auto-grading!)\n",
    "- Limited user input validation and error checking is encouraged on this assignment. Each question below will indicate the type of input that you can expect. (for example, if the question states the input will be an integer, you can expect the user to input an integer and do not need to check to ensure it is an integer versus a float or a string)\n",

    "- The examples given are samples of how we will test/grade your code. Please ensure your code outputs the same information.\n",
    "- If you are stuck on a problem or do not understand a question - please come to office hours or ask questions to the class Google group (please don't post your code though). If it is a coding problem send a private email to all of the instructors at: mids-python-instructors@googlegroups.com\n",

The bisection search won't just choose a guess at every stage of the algorithm and instead chooses a whole window that contains the actual answer.

The algorithm for Newton's method minimizes a quadratic approximation to the function and since the quadratic approximation is more accurate than the linear approximation, it is reasonable to say that the convergence speed will be faster for Newton's method compared to both the bisection search and brute force algorithms. Since Newton's method is a higher order method with faster convergence speed and better approximation to the results, the algorithm conducts a lower number of guesses and faster retrieval of returning results compared to the other 2 algorithms."
