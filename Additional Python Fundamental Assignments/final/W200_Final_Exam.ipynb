    "\n",
    "1. Inheritance: No because the Cart class is not a derived (or child) class and does not inherit properties from any parent class. For inheritance to work, the class would need to be defined to take the functionalities/properties from a parent class and allow more to be added which isn't the case with the Cart class. In other words, a class needs to inherit properties from another class for inheritance and since we are not inheriting from any other class in this situation, inheritance is not applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Polymorphism: No because in polymorphism, another function should be defined with the same function name but with different parameters whereas in the add_to_cart method situation, only a single function is defined which means polymorphism is not applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Duck typing: Yes because this is a concept of dynamic typing in which the type of the object or variable is less important than the method it defines. Since the add_to_cart method can have different types of object as the parameter, duck typing is applicable. In other words, the add_to_cart method will work when either an object of type MobileDevice or of type ServiceContract is passed to it which means that the Class demonstrates duck typing since the type of an object is less important than the method it defines.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Top-down design: Yes because the Cart class creates a list for the carts and starting total as 0, then adds onto the list and total through the add_to_cart method per the Object that was passed onto it. The class systematically breaks down the object being passed into smaller parts through the add_to_cart method and puts all of the little pieces together into the reserved __init__ method as a solution at the end. In other words, the Cart class is splitting the design from top to bottom by first defining the cart and then defining the functionalities it requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Functional programming: No because the Cart class is using Object-Oriented Programming to store data into objects. Functional programm cannot store data into objects and can only be transformed by creating functions. In functional programming, the importance is given to the functions but for the Cart class, the important is on the data."

    "b) Suppose you have a long list of digits (0-9) that you want to write to a file.  From a storage standpoint, would it be more efficient to use ASCII or UTF-8 as an encoding? What is the most efficient way to create an even smaller file to store the information?"

    "Even though ASCII and UTF-8 encodings are the same when storing digits as both encodings are identical in this character range  with UTF-8 using 1 byte for the 0-9 numbers just like ASCII, I would like to point out that ASCII may be considered more efficient for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of a human readability perspective, UTF-8 uses variable number of bits to store a number which means that the number of bytes cannot be determined due to variable length encoding. By using ASCII as the encoding, complexity of multi-byte encoding would be avoided while retaining at least some human-readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another point would be that UTF-8 is filtered over several internet gateways. In case the written file will need to work through the internet, HTTP is a network protocol defined in terms of sequences of octets and it is essential that these sequences correspond to the ASCII encoding of words like \"GET\", \"POST\", \"Accept-Language\" and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the most efficient way to create an even smaller file to store the information, compression (e.g. Python's standard ZLIB module) would be a viable option since a simple Huffman compression would use around 3 bits per byte for this kind of data and if there are any periodicity patterns, then a modern compression algorithm can take it even further. It would also be worth taking advantage of the fact that long sequences of 10-based values can be presented as 2-base (binary) values."

    "In order for the analysis to be accurate and not skewed, sanity checks are conducted to ensure data accuracy and completeness (e.g. Before analysis, sanity checks are important in determining whether the data is accurate or not as well as checking for any datatype mismatches, variations in how the values were entered or even missing data values). Running sanity checks is an important part of the data wrangling process because the final analysis is only as accurate as the data, which means that it is extremely important to validate the data's accuracy and completeness. A sanity test would allow discovery of any blockers with the analysis and eventually lead to more accurate results if performed prior to the analysis phase. If a sanity check isn't perform prior to data analysis, then there may be wasted time and effort after finding out that the results are skewed or inaccurate due to the data being flawed since the beginning. Examining the data in advance through a sanity check would allow us to surface this data quality issue and then take steps to address it. The preliminary dataset cannot be always trusted so before beginning an analysis, it is essential to encode the data and remove any invalid type of data from the dataset. This lack of trust can arise from various reasons like how was the data collected, what is the source of the data, is the data biased, has data been intentionally tampered with and so on. Performing the first two steps, i.e., initial data analysis and exploratory data analysis, it is easy to identify issues with the data set and not spend any time making false and erroneous models and predictions which in a sense could lead to huge losses of time (e.g. missed deadlines), effort, and costs if sanity checks aren't pereformed prior to analysis. For example: In the context of web applications, there is a possibility of encountering a vulnerability known as Cross Site Scripting (XSS) if the data isn't sanitized."

    "\n",
    "By performing exploratory data analysis, you would obtain a basic description of the data and focus on getting some descriptive statistics such as checking the first and last rows of the dataframe, counting the number of values in certain columns, and even retrieving samples from the data in order to gain an initial feel of the data. After gathering some information on the data, you would also take a deeper look by querying and indexing the data to test basic hypotheses that you may have about the data. Once the data has been inspected, there would probably be some features that can be of interest to the analysis such as ones that can influence the analysis positively (e.g. with feature engineering and feature selection). By initially exploring the data, you would also gain an idea of the challenges that your data can pose such as missing values or outliers along with how to handle those challenges. Lastly, you can also discover patterns in your data by either visualizing the data with packages such as matplotlib and pandas, or by using specific functions to compute the correlation between attributes. It is also worth noting that determining which variables to check for issues in the dataset may be a situation-based question since we should be choosing the variables that will have the highest impacts on our analysis. For example: In a simple student data, we must make sure that important variables such as Student ID and Student Name are valid and to remove any values from the entry if considered invalid before conducting the analysis. Another way to determine which variables in the dataset to check for issues would be to visualize the completeness of the dataset by using methods such as missingno so that the completeness of the data is less of a problem if it is identified prior to analyzing any given dataset. It can be a disaster if decisions are made on incomplete data. Another way for determination would be to identify correlation between the availability of data for two or more fields such as taking a random sample from that dataset and plotting the data for identifying how frequently the data is missing."

The function type() looks at the object provided to it as the argument and returns the type of that object. For example, type(5) will return integer as the type of the object. The second statement \"print(type(f))\" gives f as the argument to the type function. Since f is a function, the type function returns the type as a function, hence the print statement returning <class 'function'> as shown in the results."
