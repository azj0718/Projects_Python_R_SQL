Blackjack game that matches one up to six players against the dealer.

Instructions: The program will start by collecting names of the player(s) and asking for a chip balance. Then the computer dealer will deal out an initial set of cards and for each hand, the player(s) will have to either offer split, double down, hit or stand as appropriate. If the player is busted or the dealer either busts or stands, then the game will finish and move to the next round. The program will keep track of the score by showing results per round and asking to settle bets until the chip balance reaches zero. Good luck and have fun!
